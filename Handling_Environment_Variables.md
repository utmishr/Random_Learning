0. Create MyProject1 folder. Then go inside it and run commmand `python -m venv myenv` to create virtual environment.

1. **Project Structure**: Your `main.py` file should be in the `MyProject1` directory, not inside the `myenv1` virtual environment directory. The structure should be:

   ```
   MyProject1/
   │
   ├── myenv1/             # Virtual environment directory
   │   ├── Include/
   │   ├── Lib/
   │   ├── Scripts/
   │   └── ...
   │
   └── main.py             # Your Python script
   ```

2. **Using the Virtual Environment**:
   - Navigate to `MyProject1`.
   - Activate `myenv1` using `myenv1\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
   - Run `main.py` with `python main.py`.

3. **Environment Context**: When `myenv1` is activated and you run `main.py`, it will use the Python interpreter and libraries from `myenv1`.

4. **Installing Packages**: Install packages within the virtual environment (`myenv1`) to keep them project-specific and isolated.
   - Activate `myenv1` from `MyProject1`.
   - Use `pip install package_name` (e.g., `pip install requests`) to install packages into `myenv1`.
   - Deactivate the virtual environment with `deactivate` when done.

5. **No Need to Enter `myenv1` Directory**: To install packages, you don't enter the `myenv1` directory. Just activate the virtual environment from `MyProject1` and then install packages.

By adhering to these practices, you maintain a clean and efficient project structure, ensure environment isolation, and manage dependencies effectively.
